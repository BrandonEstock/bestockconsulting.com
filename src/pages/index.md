  title: Why use me?
  description: >
    Tap into my years of experience learning complex technologies across the
    entire spectrum from embedded hardware to the cloud.
description: >-
  Created and maintained a custom timesheet website used by 200-400 employees
  for the last 5 years. Installed and configured a JIRA server for my
  development team and continued to help maintain it over the next 3.5 years.
  Developed custom player software for a video wall installation used by DoD
  STARBASE and worked on-site to complete the physical integration. Developed
  software for an interactive museum exhibit at The Cardinals Hall of Fame.
  Solved workflow errors in a custom integration between Salesforce and
  QuickBooks for a local small business. Created my own WiFi controlled
  thermostat as an alternative to buying a Nest. I could go on but this should
  give a good slice of my skill set.

        Need help understanding how an existing system of yours works? I have
        learned many systems over the years so I am more than comfortable acting
        as a "reverse engineer" to help unwind how undocumented systems are
        working. Be warned this is more art than science sometimes...
